# CodingNight2023
Me and my friends' Coding Night Project from 2023

Where were three topics for a project to choose from. We decided on a educational video game for kids, which will run on Android. 
We started working on the project at 4PM and we hope to get on the top with our project, since my friends and I are competing against 16 groups.
